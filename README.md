## Future Implementations
Although this application has a robust amount of features, there is still a bright future of new features to be added. 
I look forward to:
- Allowing users to modify their reservation and itinerary
    - Modifying reservation time, modifying party size, canceling reservation
- Creating more interactions between collaborators of trips - allowing ocllaborators to pitch potential ideas/bookings to trip members and being able to release a poll to vote on the attraction of their choice that they would like to make the reservation for
- Allowing users to be able to search for bookings or specific attractions. Currently, they are only able to search for potential destinations
- Making the interface more responsive, allowing users to interact with the application on mobile devices
